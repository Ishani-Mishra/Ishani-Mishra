- 👩‍🔧🦾 Sophomore year at VIT, persuing Bachelor's in technology in Mechanical engineering. 

- ✨✨ My core interests lie in refrigeration and air conditioning, robotics and computational fluid dynamics.

- 💻🔖 I also like to explore other domains and find web development, UI design, UX research and web design super fun.

- 🚧🚧 I enjoy collaborating on projects more than working all by myself.
